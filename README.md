Summary:  Every year, soybean yields are reduced by numerous soybean diseases, including thsoe by the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). It is difficult to detect the effects of SCN in the field because there are no obvious aboveground disease symptoms. The only definitive way to assess SCN population densities is to directly extract the SCN cysts from soil and then extract the eggs from cysts and count them. Extraction is typically conducted in commercial soil analysis laboratories and university plant diagnostic clinics and involves repeated steps of sieving, washing, collecting, grinding, and cleaning. A robotic instrument was built to reproduce and automate the functions of the manual methods to extract nematode cysts from soil and later to extract eggs from the recovered nematode cysts. The performance was evaluated using soil samples infested with SCN from two farms at two locations in Iowa. Our new technology brings the benefits of automation to SCN soil diagnostics, a step towards long-term integrated pest management of this serious soybean pest.
